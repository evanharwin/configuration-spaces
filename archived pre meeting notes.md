## Looked At This Meeting (Early Feburary)

-   Demonstrated the existence of a homotopy between the configuration space of a rectangle and a manifold composed of two circles intersecting at two points.
-   Programmed the structure needed for threejs rendering, a webpage using threejs and orbit controls, as well as a script for defining the objects to render
-   Defined `Manifold`, `CirclesTwoIntersections`, `Linkage` and  `Polygon` classes. `CirclesTwoIntersections` is  fully functional and looking pretty:

    However `Polygon` still needs a little work:

-   Defined a standard way to specify the configuration of a manifold.
-   Found and understood the Classification of 2-Manifolds. As well as finding an example of a linkage that provides as a configuration space the orientable manifolds of genus 0 through 3 in Kevin Walkers paper, however I don't fully understand this yet. Somehow it's meant to pop out of this diagram?
