# Math Project

### Introduction / Abstract / Working Definitions

#### Basic Idea

This much should be clear, introducing the project and the problems I hope to tackle.

#### Potential Topic Subtitles

##### Defining a Linkage

##### Defining a Configuration Space

##### What we can hope to learn about linkages from topology

##### What we can hope to learn about topology from linkages

### Finding the Configuration Space of a Linkage

#### Basic Idea

This section would introduce the configuration space with some basic results like talking about arms and polygons and what configuration spaces they provide.



To expand on this maybe talk about studying ranges and if that leads to a quotient topological space and if we can work with that (needs more research)

#### Potential Topic Subtitles

##### Examples Finding Configuration Space of a Linkage

##### Defining Homotopies between linkage states and Manifolds

##### Considering Permutations of the Length function on our Graph

In this section I should look at Simplex's as described in Kevin Walkers Paper as well as discussing the different types of structures we can form with an arm and a switch.

##### Looking at the ranges our coordinates can take and potential linkage -> manifold algorithm

### Finding Linkages for a Given Manifold

#### Basic Idea

This is where I really want to have a result describing an algorithm that will give you a linkage for any 2-manifold given a genus and an orientability. However, I can't explain that, and haven't seen the result anywhere so might be a bit of a stretch. So this topic at the moment can talk about the degrees of freedom of a linkage, and list some manifolds and corresponding linkages.

#### Potential Topic Subtitles

##### Mapping Manifold Properties to Linkages

##### Degrees of Freedom

##### The Classification Theorem for 2-Manifolds

##### Linkage for the orientable 2-manifold with genus $2^n$

### The Effect of Transforming Configuration Spaces

#### Basic Idea

Looking at the Siefert-van Kampen Theorem on the rectangle and types of looping, maybe more to play with here looking at different linkages, but following the basic idea of taking the configuration space, manipulating it and then looking at what that gives us when we map it back to the linkage.

#### Potential Topic Titles

##### The fundamental group of our configuration space

##### What it means to continuously deform our configuration space

##### Siefert-van Kampen Theorem and the rectangle
