#### Defining a Linkage

This project will look at structures known as planar linkages. These are composed of a simple, connected and finite graph $L$ paired with a length function $\ell: E(L) \rarr \mathbb R^+$. The notation $(L,\ell)$ denotes this linkage.

These linkages should be intuitively thought of as a series of rigid rods in the real plane, joined with rotating joints at the ends. This project shall ignore the possibility of constraints on movement of this linkage brought about by collision of these rods.

#### Defining a Configuration Space

The way we shall relate these linkages to topological objects is through the notion of a configuration space (sometimes called a moduli space in other literature on the topic). The idea behind this is to look at the unique configurations that our linkage can be manipulated into. The notion of closeness in our configuration space comes from making small adjustments to the angles subtended from the rods in our linkages.

The configuration space $M$ of a linkage $(L,\ell )$ shall be defined as follows:

$$ M(L,\ell) := \{(\boldsymbol\alpha_1,..., \boldsymbol\alpha_n) \in (\mathbb S^1)^n | for \, any \, cycle \, l_i, ..., l_j\, in \, L: \sum_{k=i}^j \boldsymbol\alpha_k \ell_k = 0 \}$$ / modulo

### Finding the Configuration Space of a Linkage

#### Basic Idea

This section would introduce the configuration space with some basic results like talking about arms and polygons and what configuration spaces they provide.



To expand on this maybe talk about studying ranges and if that leads to a quotient topological space and if we can work with that (needs more research)

##### Examples Finding Configuration Space of a Linkage

##### Defining Homotopies between linkage states and Manifolds

##### Considering Permutations of the Length function on our Graph

In this section I should look at Simplex's as described in Kevin Walkers Paper as well as discussing the different types of structures we can form with an arm and a switch.

##### Looking at the ranges our coordinates can take and potential linkage -> manifold algorithm

### Finding Linkages for a Given Manifold

#### Basic Idea

This is where I really want to have a result describing an algorithm that will give you a linkage for any 2-manifold given a genus and an orientability. However, I can't explain that, and haven't seen the result anywhere so might be a bit of a stretch. So this topic at the moment can talk about the degrees of freedom of a linkage, and list some manifolds and corresponding linkages.

### The Effect of Transforming Configuration Spaces

#### Basic Idea

Looking at the Siefert-van Kampen Theorem on the rectangle and types of looping, maybe more to play with here looking at different linkages, but following the basic idea of taking the configuration space, manipulating it and then looking at what that gives us when we map it back to the linkage.
